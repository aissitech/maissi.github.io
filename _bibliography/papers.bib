  abstract={Abstract:
  This paper aims to briefly summarize and outline the modern state of USVs (Unmanned Surface Vehicles) and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) technologies performing tasks in a cooperative way, and a proposed solution of a solar USV concept design, to satisfy the primary goal for creating a long-lasting mobile autonomous launch-and-recovery system for UAV, autonomous batteries charging and missions planning. This includes as well, a related problematic, and reasons that motivate the research, a comparison between recent existing systems and conceptual design. The results of a proposed solution and conceptual design are summarized with reference to the project's goals, while future works involved within the project are also discussed.},

  abstract={This study offers a comprehensive overview of the integration and impact of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the field of mobile robotics. Focusing on the period from 2000 to 2023, The evolution and influence of DRL are analyzed through a detailed citation analysis, leveraging data from major scholarly databases. The core concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL) are explored, emphasizing its application in mobile robotics for balancing exploration and exploitation, a critical aspect of autonomous decision-making processes. The paper delves into various applications of DRL in mobile robotics, including autonomous navigation, path planning, and target tracking, highlighting the advancements that have significantly enhanced robotic capabilities. A review of recent developments is also included in the analysis, such as Successor Representations and latent imagination learning strategies, illustrating their contribution to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Additionally, the advantages of DRL, such as adaptability and learning from experience, alongside challenges like hardware limitations and dynamic environment adaptability. The paper concludes by identifying key future research directions, notably in generalization and transfer learning, robustness to uncertain environments, and the potential role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in further advancing RL for mobile robotics. This overview aims to provide a clear understanding of the current state and future potential of DRL in enhancing the efficiency and intelligence of mobile robotic systems.},

    abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
